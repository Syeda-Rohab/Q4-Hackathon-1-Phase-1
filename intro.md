## What You'll Learn

This textbook covers the fundamentals of **Physical AI** — artificial intelligence systems that interact with the physical world through embodied robots. You'll explore:

- The principles of embodied intelligence and why physical interaction matters
- How humanoid robots are designed and controlled
- Sensor fusion and perception systems for robots
- Actuators and motion planning for bipedal locomotion
- AI techniques for robot control (RL, imitation learning)
- Manipulation and dexterity in robotic systems
